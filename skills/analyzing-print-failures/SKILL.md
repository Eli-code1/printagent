description: >-
  Diagnoses FDM 3D-print failures from a photo or a symptom description — warping, stringing,
  layer shifting, under-extrusion, elephant's foot, delamination, ghosting, pillowing, clogs,
  support and bridging failures — identifies the failure mode, classifies it as design-time
  preventable vs a process/printer setting, and returns the remedy plus where to route the fix.
  Use when a print failed, looks wrong, or the user asks why a print came out badly or how to
  troubleshoot it.

# Analyzing print failures

This skill is the post-print diagnostic. It maps a symptom (often a photo) to a failure mode,
then routes the fix: geometric causes go back to `generating-build123d`; process causes become
a setting recommendation for the slicing/printer agent, which the design loop cannot apply
itself. Many design-time-preventable failures should already have been caught by the
manufacturability gate before printing — if one appears post-print, it usually means the part
skipped the gate or was printed in a different orientation.

## How to use
1. **Identify the failure mode.** From a photo, match against the visual fingerprints in
   `references/failure-modes.md`. From a description, match the symptom. If a part shows
   "spaghetti," treat it as a *secondary* failure and diagnose from what is left on the bed.
2. **Classify and route.** Call the lookup:

       python scripts/route_failure.py warping

   It returns the classification (`design_time` | `process` | `mixed`), the visual signs, the
   geometric and process causes, the design fix, the process fix, and the route.
3. **Act on the route.**
   - `generating-build123d` → hand back a concrete geometry edit (reorient, chamfer, vent,
     thicken, fillet). Then re-run the manufacturability gate.
   - `slicer_printer` → emit a setting recommendation (temperature, retraction, speed, cooling,
     bed adhesion, belt tension, input shaping). The design loop is advisory here; it does not
     drive the slicer or printer.
   - `both` → do the geometry edit you can *and* emit the process hint, so the downstream
     slicing agent can complement it.

## Vision guidance (matching from a photo)
Look for the discriminating sign, not the overall mess: a single abrupt horizontal step at one
height is a layer shift; a base wider than the body that is smooth (not curling) is elephant's
foot; horizontal cracks mid-height are delamination; hairy strands between features are
stringing; repeating wave echoes fading from sharp corners are ghosting; top-surface
depressions following the infill pattern below are pillowing; lifted corners with a gap under
the base are warping.

## Scope
- This skill diagnoses; it does not implement process fixes (no slicer/printer control).
- It is advisory. Material, printer model, and environment change the likely cause, so present
  the ranked causes from the lookup rather than asserting a single one.
- This is a sensitive-failure-free domain, but if a user is frustrated, lead with the most
  likely fix, not a lecture.
